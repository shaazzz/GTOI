k-Connected Graph
=================
The first question that made this section meaningful was: what is the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed from a graph to make it disconnected?

k-Connected Graph
-----------------

A graph is called k-connected if it has more than k vertices, and if fewer than k vertices are removed from the graph, it does not become disconnected. Furthermore, k is the maximum possible such value, and it is denoted by :math:`\kappa (G)`.
Another definition for this concept exists, which states: "the minimum number of vertices whose removal from the graph makes the graph disconnected." However, this definition has a problem, which concerns complete graphs. If you notice, you can never disconnect complete graphs by removing any number of vertices; at most, you can reduce it to an isolated vertex. Given this, we can correct the second definition with a slight modification.
Therefore, we can say:
- The minimum number of vertices whose removal from the graph makes the graph disconnected or results in an isolated vertex.
:math:`\kappa (u,v)` is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects the path between u and v (or, in other words, places them in two separate components).

k-Edge-Connected Graph
----------------------
It is defined similarly to k-connected graphs, except this definition applies to edges instead of vertices.
Therefore, a k-edge-connected graph is a graph that can be made disconnected or reduced to an isolated vertex by removing at least k edges, which we denote by :math:`\kappa^{\prime}(G)`. Note that this value can also be zero. If the graph is connected and has a cut edge, its edge-connectivity is one.
Also, :math:`\kappa^{\prime}(u,v)` is defined as the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects the path between u and v, placing them in two separate components.

Menger's Theorem
----------------
Several paths between vertices u and v are called disjoint if these paths have no common vertices other than u and v. Now, it can be stated that the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects the path between two vertices u and v is equal to the maximum number of disjoint paths between these two vertices.

The same theorem applies to edges, stating that the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects the path between two vertices is equal to the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths between these two vertices.
