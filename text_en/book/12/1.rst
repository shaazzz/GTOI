Cuts and Connectivity
=====================
Connectivity is one of the most widely used topics in graph theory, also applied in programming. Without further ado, let's move towards definitions and theorems to become more familiar with connectivity.

Connectivity
------------
A graph is connected if there is a path between any two vertices in the graph.

Connected Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each connected subgraph of a graph is called a connected component. A graph with more than one component is called a **disconnected** graph. For example, in a forest, each existing tree is called a component, and the number of components in the forest is equal to the number of trees present. In the forest below, each component is shown with a different color.

Connectivity in Directed Graphs
-------------------------------

Weakly Connected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we replace the directed edges of a directed graph with undirected edges, and the resulting undirected graph is connected, then the original directed graph (with directed edges) is said to be weakly connected.

Strongly Connected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A directed graph is strongly connected if for any two vertices u and v, there is a directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u.

Algorithms for finding strongly connected components are used to solve :math:`2-SAT` problems.

Strong Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Strong components are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs of a graph.

Cuts
----

Cut Vertex
~~~~~~~~~~
A vertex is called a cut vertex (or articulation point) if its removal from the graph increases the number of its connected components.

Cut Edge
~~~~~~~~
A cut edge (or bridge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. It is also referred to as a bridge. An edge uv that is part of a cycle in a graph cannot be a cut edge, because if it is removed, the two vertices u and v will still have a path between them, so no new component is added to the graph.
