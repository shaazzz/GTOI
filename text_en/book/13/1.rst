Definition

A matching is a set of edges such that no two of them share a common vertex.

Mathematically, if we consider the graph as :math:`G` and its set of edges as :math:`E`, a subset of :math:`E` in which no two members share a common vertex in :math:`G` is called a matching or an independent set of edges, and is denoted by :math:`M`.

A vertex that is an endpoint of one of the edges in a matching of graph :math:`G` is called a saturated (or matched) vertex; otherwise, it is called an unsaturated (or unmatched) vertex.

Maximal and Maximum Matchings
------------------------------

A maximal matching is a matching in :math:`G` such that if any other edge not in the matching is added to it, the resulting set of edges ceases to be a matching. In other words, a matching :math:`M` is maximal if every edge of :math:`G` intersects at least one edge in :math:`M`.

A maximum matching is a matching that has the largest number of edges in :math:`G`. Therefore, it can be concluded that every maximum matching is a maximal matching, but not every maximal matching is necessarily a maximum matching.

A perfect matching is also a matching in which all vertices are saturated (essentially, its number of edges is :math:`|G| / 2`). It can also be easily seen that a maximal matching is at least half the size of a maximum matching.

Alternating and Augmenting Paths
-------------------------

An alternating path is a path whose edges alternate between being in the matching and being outside the matching.

An augmenting path is an alternating path whose first and last vertices are unsaturated and are not part of the matching.

A matching is maximum if and only if it contains no augmenting path, a conclusion also known as Berge's Theorem.

To prove that a maximum matching has no augmenting path, we can assume, for contradiction, that there is an augmenting path. Since an augmenting path is an alternating path and its first and last vertices are not saturated by the matching, we can remove the matching edges within this path from the matching and add the other edges of this path to the matching instead. Because the first and last vertices are unsaturated, the number of non-matching edges in any augmenting path is one greater than the number of matching edges. Therefore, the size of the matching increases by one, creating a larger matching, which contradicts the assumption that the initial matching was maximum. Thus, a maximum matching has no augmenting path.

The converse of this theorem, i.e., if a matching has no augmenting path then it is a maximum matching, can also be proven by contradiction: Suppose :math:`M'` is a maximal matching without an augmenting path, and :math:`M` is a maximum matching. Consider the graph :math:`M \Delta M'`. The degree of each vertex in it is at most two. Thus, this graph consists of a set of alternating cycles and paths. In cycles and even paths, the number of edges from both matchings is equal. In odd paths, the first and last edges must belong to :math:`M`, because otherwise, we could have used edges from :math:`M'` instead of :math:`M` in the path and increased the size of the matching. Therefore, if we have an odd path, it means we have at least one augmenting path, which is a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that there are no odd paths, and :math:`|M| = |M'|`.

Vertex and Edge Covers
----------------------

A set (cover) of vertices such that every edge has at least one of its endpoints in this set is called a vertex cover.

A set (cover) of edges such that every vertex has at least one of its incident edges in this set is called an edge cover.

A vertex cover with the minimum number of vertices is called a minimum vertex cover, and an edge cover with the minimum number of edges is called a minimum edge cover.
