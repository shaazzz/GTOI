Isomorphism
============

Two graphs *G* and *H* are called **isomorphic** (written as *G â‰ƒ H*) if there exists a bijective correspondence between their vertices that preserves adjacency relationships. In other words, if every pair of adjacent vertices in *G* corresponds to a pair of adjacent vertices in *H*, and vice versa.

Necessary conditions for two graphs to be isomorphic:
-----------------------------------------------------
- They must have the **same number of vertices**
- They must have the **same number of edges**
- Their vertices must have **matching degrees** (same degree sequence)

.. code-block:: python

    def is_isomorphic(graph1, graph2):
        # Check number of vertices
        if len(graph1.nodes) != len(graph2.nodes):  # If number of vertices isn't equal
            return False
        
        # Check number of edges    
        if len(graph1.edges) != len(graph2.edges):  # If number of edges isn't equal
            return False
            
        # Check degree sequences
        if sorted(graph1.degrees) != sorted(graph2.degrees):  # Compare sorted degree lists
            return False
            
        # More detailed checks needed for full verification
        return True

.. note::
    In reality, checking graph isomorphism is computationally complex (NP problem). The above code only verifies basic conditions. For full verification, more advanced algorithms like VF2 or UWLCM are used, with time complexity up to ``O(n!)`` in worst cases.

Identical Graphs
----------------
Consider graphs G and H.
If V(G) = V(H) and E(G) = E(H), then we say graphs G and H are identical.

Isomorphism
-----------
Consider graphs G and H.  
We define a bijective function f(u) that maps each vertex u in graph G to a corresponding vertex in graph H, with the condition that f(u) and f(v) are equal only if u equals v.  

If we can construct a function f between the vertices of G and H such that replacing each vertex u in graph G with f(u) makes the two graphs identical, we say the graphs are **isomorphic**.  

In other words, an edge uv exists in G **if and only if** the edge f(u)f(v) also exists in H; in this case, the two graphs are isomorphic.

Automorphism
------------
A simple definition of an automorphism is a graph morphism to itself.  
That is, by permuting the vertices of the graph, the edge set remains unchanged.
