Isomorphism
============

Identical Graphs
----------------
Consider graphs G and H.
If V(G) = V(H) and E(G) = E(H), we say that graphs G and H are identical.

Isomorphism
----------
Consider graphs G and H.
Let's define a bijective function f, mapping each vertex u in graph G to a corresponding vertex f(u) in graph H, with the condition that f(u) and f(v) are equal if and only if u and v are equal.
If such a function f can be established between the vertices of G and H that, by mapping each vertex u in graph G to its image f(u), the two graphs become identical, we say these two graphs are isomorphic.
In other words, an edge uv exists in G if and only if an edge f(u)f(v) exists in H; in this case, the two graphs are isomorphic.

Automorphism
-----------
The simple definition of automorphism is an isomorphism of a graph to itself.
That is, by permuting the vertices of the graph, the set of edges does not change.
