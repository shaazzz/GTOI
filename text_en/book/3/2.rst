Tournament
=============================================================================================

**Definition 3.2.1 (Tournament)**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A tournament is a simple, complete graph whose edges have been directed (Figure 1 shows a tournament with 5 vertices).

An :math:`n`-vertex tournament can model competitions between :math:`n` teams such that a directed edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2 exists if and only if team 1 has defeated team 2 (as in Figure 1).

Kings in Tournaments
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition 3.2.2 (King)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A king is a vertex in a tournament that has a directed path of length at most 2 to all other vertices in the tournament. For example, vertex 3 is a king in Figure 1.

**Theorem 3.2.3**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Statement of the Theorem :** Every tournament has at least one king.

**Proof of the Theorem :** Let :math:`v` be a vertex with out-degree :math:`\Delta^{+}` in the tournament, i.e., a vertex with the maximum out-degree. If there exists a vertex :math:`u` such that there is no path of length at most 2 from :math:`v` to :math:`u`, then :math:`u` must have a directed edge to :math:`v` and to all vertices :math:`w` such that :math:`(v,w) \in E` (Figure 2). In this case, :math:`d^{+}(u) \geq \Delta^{+}+1`, which contradicts the maximality of the out-degree of :math:`v`. Therefore, no such vertex :math:`u` exists that cannot be reached from :math:`v` by at most two edges, and thus :math:`v` is a king.

Theorem 3.2.3 implies that, for example, in a tournament of competitions, there exists an individual :math:`v` such that for every other individual :math:`u`, either :math:`v` has defeated :math:`u`, or :math:`v` has defeated someone who has defeated :math:`u`.

Hamiltonian Paths in Tournaments
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition 3.2.4 (Hamiltonian Path in a Directed Graph)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Hamiltonian path in a directed graph is a directed path that passes through all vertices.

**Theorem 3.2.5**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Statement of the Theorem :** Every tournament has at least one Hamiltonian path.

**Proof of the Theorem :** Let vertices :math:`a_1` to :math:`a_k` form the longest directed path in the tournament (Figure 3).

If :math:`k = n`, the theorem is proven. Otherwise, there exists a vertex :math:`v` that is not on this path. There cannot be a directed edge from :math:`v` to :math:`a_1` and from :math:`a_k` to :math:`v` (why?). So, assume :math:`a_i` is the vertex with the smallest :math:`i` among all vertices from :math:`a_1` to :math:`a_k` such that :math:`v` has an edge to :math:`a_i`. In this case, the vertices :math:`a_1,...,a_{i-1},v,a_i,...,a_k` form a path of length :math:`k+1`, which contradicts the assumption that the longest path has length :math:`k`. Therefore, :math:`k = n`, and :math:`a_1` to :math:`a_k` form a Hamiltonian path.
