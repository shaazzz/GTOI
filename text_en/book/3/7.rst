Functional Graph and Permutation Graph
=============================================

Definition 3.7.1 (Permutation Graph)
------------------------------
Consider a permutation
:math:`P: p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, ..., p_{n}`
of numbers 1 to n.

Consider an
:math:`n`
-vertex graph
:math:`G`
whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n.

For each
:math:`1 \le i \le n`
, draw a directed edge from
:math:`i`
to
:math:`p_{i}`
. We call this graph a permutation graph, constructed from the permutation
:math:`P`
.

For example, consider the permutation
:math:`P: 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6`
. The following graph is a permutation graph for this permutation:

Theorem 3.7.2
------------------------------
**Statement of the Theorem :** The vertices of a permutation graph are partitioned into a set of cycles.

**Proof of the Theorem :** For every vertex in a permutation graph, its in-degree and out-degree are exactly one. We know that a directed graph where the in-degree and out-degree of every vertex are equal to one is partitioned into a set of cycles (why?!).

Theorem 3.7.3
------------------------------
**Statement of the Theorem :** If two elements in a permutation are swapped, then the number of cycles in its permutation graph changes by exactly one.

**Proof of the Theorem :** The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise for the reader.
