Functional Graphs and Permutation Graphs
=============================================

A **functional graph** is a directed graph where each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge. In other words, if we consider the graph of function *f: V → V*, each vertex *v* is connected by an edge to vertex *f(v)*. Therefore, every functional graph corresponds to a function on its vertex set.

Example: The following graph represents the function *f* with mapping::

   .. code-block:: graphviz

      digraph FG {
          node [shape=circle];
          1 -> 2;  // f(1)=2
          2 -> 3;  // f(2)=3
          3 -> 2;  // f(3)=2
          4 -> 4;  // f(4)=4
          5 -> 4;  // f(5)=4
          6 -> 5;  // f(6)=5
      }

**Permutation graphs** are a special case of functional graphs where the corresponding function is a permutation (bijection) on the vertex set. Since permutations are bijective, every vertex has exactly one incoming edge and one outgoing edge.

 Definition 3.7.1 (Permutation Graph)
 ------------------------------
 Consider a permutation 
 :math:`P: p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, ..., p_{n}` 
 of numbers 1 to n.

 Consider a graph 
 :math:`G` 
 with n vertices labeled from 1 to n.

 For each 
 :math:`1 \le i \le n`, 
 we draw a directed edge from 
 :math:`i` 
 to 
 :math:`p_{i}`. 
 This graph is called a **permutation graph** constructed from permutation 
 :math:`P`.

 For example, consider the permutation 
 :math:`P: 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6`. 
 The following graph is a permutation graph for this permutation:

Theorem 3.7.2
------------------------------
**Theorem Statement:** The vertices of a permutation graph can be partitioned into a number of cycles.

**Proof:** For every vertex in the permutation graph, its in-degree and out-degree are exactly 1. We know that any directed graph where the in-degree and out-degree of every vertex are equal to 1 can be partitioned into a number of cycles (Why?)!

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    def partition_cycles(graph):  # Translated from "تابع افراز به دورها"
        visited = set()
        cycles = []
        // The vertices of the permutation graph here
        for node in graph.nodes:  # گراف را پیمایش می‌کنیم
            if node not in visited:
                cycle = []
                current = node
                while current not in visited:
                    visited.add(current)
                    cycle.append(current)
                    current = graph.successors(current)[0]  # تنها همسایه خروجی
                cycles.append(cycle)
        return cycles

.. note::
    The core of the proof relies on the property that permutation graphs are composed of disjoint cycles. This is directly tied to their representation of bijective functions.

Theorem 3.7.3
------------------------------
**Theorem Statement:** If two elements are swapped in a permutation, then the number of cycles in its permutation graph changes by exactly one.

**Proof:** The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise for the reader.
