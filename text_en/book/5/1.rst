Introduction
============

Definitions
-----------

An Eulerian tour is a closed walk in which every edge is traversed exactly once.
A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in which every vertex is visited exactly once. Similarly, a Hamiltonian path is a path in which every vertex is visited exactly once.

Pay attention to the difference between a walk, a trail, and a path!

The definitions of an Eulerian tour and a Hamiltonian cycle are very similar, but this single subtle difference (substituting "vertex" for "edge") has led to the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle not having a polynomial-time algorithm, whereas a linear-time algorithm can be provided for finding an Eulerian tour!

The Bridges of Königsberg
----------------

Legend has it that the concept of graphs originated from the problem of the Bridges of Königsberg.
Königsberg was a city divided into several regions by a river, and the regions were connected by bridges. After some time, the citizens wondered if it was possible to start from one of the regions, traverse each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting region?!
As you can see, the problem is exactly equivalent to finding an Eulerian tour.
