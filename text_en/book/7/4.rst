Adjacency Matrix
----------------

The adjacency matrix is an n × n matrix used to represent simple graphs. In this matrix, :math:`a_{ij}` denotes the number of edges between vertex i and vertex j in the graph. If you observe, you'll notice that this matrix is symmetric. The entries of this matrix are 0 or 1.

In Graphs with Multiple Edges and Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In these graphs, the adjacency matrix is used with its original definition, the difference being that the entries are no longer necessarily 0 or 1 and can take any non-negative integer value.

In Directed Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In directed graphs, the adjacency matrix is defined such that :math:`a_{ij}` represents the number of edges going from vertex i to vertex j.

A final point regarding the adjacency matrix is that it is not used when the graph is weighted, although a matrix similar to this one is used in finding shortest paths, and in all the definitions above, the edges are unweighted.
