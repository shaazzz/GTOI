Matrices and Operations on Them
==================================

Matrices are abstract structures, similar to graphs, that are used in many sciences. Matrices are the foundation of linear algebra, which is widely used in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. In Olympiads, matrices are also used in complex algorithms like FFT, and familiarity with them is beneficial for an Olympiad student.

In this chapter, we will gain a brief familiarity with matrices, and then we will examine the relationship between matrices and graphs to help us present fast algorithms for several problems.

Matrix
-------
Any rectangular arrangement of real numbers, consisting of a number of rows and columns, is a matrix. Each real number located within a matrix is called an **entry** of that matrix.

:math:`\begin{equation*}
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
12 & 78 & -120 \\
3.7 & -809 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`
:math:`\begin{equation*}
B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3  \\
4 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`
:math:`\begin{equation*}
C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.5 & -90 \\
0 & 4.09 \\
5 & 6 \\
92 & 37 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`

Order of a Matrix
-------------
A matrix with m columns and n rows is said to be of **order** n × m.

Addition and Subtraction of Matrices
-----------------------
To add two matrices, the first step is to ensure that both matrices have the same number of rows and the same number of columns (it is not necessary for the number of rows to equal the number of columns). In the next step, each entry of matrix A is added to the corresponding entry in matrix B to form the corresponding entry in C. Subtraction is performed in the same way.

:math:`\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 4  \\
1 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 2  \\
4 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6  \\
5 & 4 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`

:math:`\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
37 & 7  \\
0 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}
-
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 13  \\
2 & -5 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
31 & -6  \\
-2 & 8 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`

Multiplication of Matrices
--------------
For matrix multiplication, it must first be noted that if matrix A has n rows and m columns, then matrix B must have m rows and z columns. In this case, the resulting matrix C will have n rows and z columns. The entry :math:`c_{ij}` is equal to the sum of :math:`a_{ik} × b_{kj}`, where k is a natural number whose maximum value is m.


:math:`\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 3 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
7  \\
-5 \\
10 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
48 \\
-25 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`

Scalar Multiplication
-------------------
When a real number k is multiplied by a matrix, all entries of that matrix are multiplied by k.

:math:`\begin{equation*}
5
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
2 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 5 \\
10 & 15 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}`
