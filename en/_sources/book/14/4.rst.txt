Identical Graphs

Identical Graphs
----------------
Consider graphs G and H.
Graphs G and H are said to be identical if V(G) = V(H) and E(G) = E(H).

Isomorphism
----------
Consider graphs G and H.
Let's define a bijective function f from V(G) to V(H), where f(u) is the corresponding vertex in graph H for vertex u in graph G, with the condition that f(u) and f(v) are equal if and only if u is equal to v.
If a function f can be created between the vertices of G and H such that by mapping each vertex u in graph G to f(u), the two graphs become identical (i.e., the structure of G under f perfectly matches H), then these two graphs are called isomorphic.
In other words, an edge uv exists in G if and only if an edge f(u)f(v) also exists in H; in this case, the two graphs are isomorphic.

Automorphism
-----------
The simple definition of automorphism is an isomorphism of a graph to itself.
Meaning, by permuting the vertices of the graph, the set of edges does not change.
