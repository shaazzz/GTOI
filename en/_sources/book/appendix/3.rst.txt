Cheat Sheet
==========================

The goal of this book's graph theory instruction is not to memorize definitions. Whenever you forget a definition, you can refer to this page, and doing so does not mean cheating at all (the page title is merely an idiom).

Note that this page is not for teaching; the content is summarized so that only someone already familiar with it can recall it. For learning, use the lessons.

Numbers
-------
- Independence number or maximum independent set (alpha :math:`\alpha`):
  The maximum number of vertices in a graph that have no edges between them.
- Maximum matching (alpha prime :math:`\alpha^{\prime}`):
  The maximum number of edges in a graph such that no two edges share a common vertex.
- Minimum vertex cover (beta :math:`\beta`):
  The minimum number of vertices in a graph such that every edge has at least one endpoint in these vertices.
- Minimum edge cover (beta prime :math:`\beta^{\prime}`):
  The minimum number of edges in a graph such that every vertex is an endpoint of at least one of these edges.
- Chromatic number (chi :math:`\chi`):
  The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
- Edge chromatic number (chi prime :math:`\chi^{\prime}`):
  The minimum number of colors required to color the edges of a graph such that no two incident edges have the same color.
- Vertex connectivity (kappa :math:`\kappa`)
  The minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph.
- Edge connectivity (kappa prime :math:`\kappa^{\prime}`)
  The minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects the graph.
- Clique number (omega :math:`\omega`):
  The maximum number of vertices in a graph that are pairwise adjacent.
- Minimum degree (small delta :math:`\delta`):
  The minimum number of edges incident to any vertex in the graph.
- Maximum degree (capital delta :math:`\Delta`):
  The maximum number of edges incident to any vertex in the graph.
