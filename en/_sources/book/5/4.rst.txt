Existence Theorems for Hamiltonian Cycles
=========================================

Basic Lemma
-----------

Consider a simple graph :math:`G` with :math:`n` vertices, which has two non-adjacent vertices :math:`a, b` such that :math:`d_a + d_b \geq n`. Now consider graph :math:`H`, which is the same as graph :math:`G` except that vertices :math:`a, b` are connected by an edge. We claim that graph :math:`G` has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if graph :math:`H` has a Hamiltonian cycle.

The first part of the proof is clear, because if :math:`G` has a Hamiltonian cycle, :math:`H` will also have that cycle. (No edge was removed.)

Now, to prove the second part, assume :math:`H` has a Hamiltonian cycle. If this cycle does not use the edge :math:`ab`, then :math:`G` also has the same cycle, and the claim is proven. So, assume this cycle uses the edge :math:`ab`. Consequently, there must exist a Hamiltonian path in :math:`G` that starts at :math:`a` and ends at :math:`b`.

Now, suppose our Hamiltonian path is :math:`a = v_1, v_2, ..., v_n = b`. If :math:`v_1` has an edge to :math:`v_i` and :math:`v_n` has an edge to :math:`v_{i-1}`, then we can find a Hamiltonian cycle in graph :math:`G`. (Go directly from :math:`v_1` to :math:`v_i`, then traverse the path from :math:`v_i` to :math:`v_n`, then go directly from :math:`v_n` to :math:`v_{i-1}`, then traverse the path from :math:`v_{i-1}` to :math:`v_1`).

Now, for every vertex :math:`v_i` such that :math:`v_1` has an edge to it, color :math:`v_{i-1}` red. And for every vertex :math:`v_i` such that :math:`v_n` has an edge to it, color :math:`v_i` blue. If we can prove that there exists a vertex that has been colored both red and blue, the problem will be solved. We know that by assumption :math:`d_a + d_b \geq n`, so the number of vertices we colored is at least :math:`n`. On the other hand, vertex :math:`v_n` is never colored (why?). So we have :math:`n-1` vertices that have been colored at least :math:`n` times. Therefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a vertex that has been colored twice. Thus, there exists a vertex that is both blue and red simultaneously, which implies that a Hamiltonian cycle exists in :math:`G`.

Other Theorems
--------------

Here we present a few theorems that you can easily prove using the basic lemma stated above.

- If, in graph :math:`G`, the degree of every vertex is at least :math:`\frac{n}{2}`, then a Hamiltonian cycle exists in this graph.
- If, in graph :math:`G`, for any two non-adjacent vertices :math:`a` and :math:`b`, we have :math:`d_a + d_b \geq n`, then a Hamiltonian cycle exists in this graph.
