Adjacency Matrix
================

Adjacency Matrix
----------------

The adjacency matrix is an n Ã— n matrix used to represent simple graphs. In this matrix, :math:`a_{ij}` represents the number of edges between vertex i and vertex j in the graph. If you observe, you'll notice that this matrix is symmetric. The entries of this matrix are either zero or one.

In Graphs with Multiple Edges and Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In these graphs, the adjacency matrix is used with its original definition, the difference being that the entries are no longer necessarily zero or one and can take any non-negative integer value.

In Directed Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In directed graphs, the adjacency matrix is defined such that :math:`a_{ij}` represents the number of edges going from vertex i to j.

A final point regarding the adjacency matrix is that it is not used when the graph has weights, although a matrix similar to it is used in finding shortest paths, and in all the definitions above, the edges are unweighted.
